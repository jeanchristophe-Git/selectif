⚠️  SECURITY NOTICE ⚠️

This application contains an admin panel with an intentionally obscure URL path.

NEVER COMMIT OR SHARE:
- The admin login URL path
- Admin credentials
- .env files containing ADMIN_LOGIN_PATH

The admin path is currently set to a random hex value to avoid detection by
automated scanners and brute force attacks.

For production deployment:
1. Generate a NEW random path using: node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(16).toString('hex'))"
2. Update the folder name in app/
3. Update ADMIN_LOGIN_PATH in .env
4. Implement server-side rate limiting
5. Enable IP-based monitoring
6. Set up alerts for failed login attempts

See ADMIN_ACCESS.md for full security documentation.
